🌆 Urban Sentiment Analytics – Power BI Dashboard
311 Service Request Analysis & City Operations Performance

This project presents a comprehensive Power BI analytics dashboard that evaluates urban service requests, response efficiency, and service quality across multiple neighborhoods. The dashboard uses structured data from 311 service records to uncover insights about operational performance, citizen engagement, and service patterns.

🚀 Project Overview

City operations generate thousands of service requests daily, covering issues such as garbage collection, pothole repair, noise complaints, and more.
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Monitor request volume across neighborhoods

Evaluate service performance through SLA compliance

Analyze resolution efficiency

Identify dominant request types

Visualize requests geographically using latitude/longitude mapping

This helps city officials, analysts, and decision-makers take data-driven actions to improve urban services.
